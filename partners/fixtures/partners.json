A transiting exoplanet is one that periodically passes in front of its host star, causing the star to slightly dim (by about 1%). Observing exoplanet transits is important, as they allow us to directly measure a planet's radius and composition. Ground based follow up allows us to better constrain the planet’s period which allows for better mass measurements. Exoplanet Watch will help increase the efficiency of exoplanet studies by large telescopes to characterize exoplanet atmospheres by reducing uncertainty about the predicted timing of transit events.",

They will be given instruction on the research process and then work in groups to conduct a project, selecting from several types, including double star astrometry, RR Lyrae photometry, exoplanet and asteroid light curves, variable star light curves and gamma ray burst follow-up optical observations. This program will be based in part on the Astronomy Research Seminar, taught for the past 10 years out Cuesta Community college in which student groups propose and then carry out a study of a double star system or several systems, collecting and analyzing data and writing up their analysis in a paper for publication in the Journal of Double Star Observations, all within the time frame of a single semester. Students then present their project in either an online or in-person meeting. This program is unique in its requirement for publication by students, and has been successful due to the large Community-of-Practice involved in the program. This proposal would expand the seminar to other groups of students, outside of Cuesta. The longer-term goal is to expand the program nationally, incorporating a larger community being established through the Global Telescope Network (GTN). Working with advanced amateurs, such as AAVSO members, as well as NASA and other subject matter experts, we hope to include research projects on eclipsing binaries, asteroids and exoplanet transits.

        "summary": "Modeling Instruction is largely regarded as one of the most effective pedagogies known, and making LCO telescopes a part of MI Astronomy will enable gradual and steady growth into eventually many classrooms in the United States. In particular, a very important feature of Modeling Instruction is that the MI Workshops are in high demand by US teachers, are usually filled, and also self-supporting. Teachers/schools will pay for such workshops, because MI supports state and National Standards, kids learn more, they score better on tests, attain higher grades, and are more interested in careers in science and technology. Moving into a system that is sustained by word-of-mouth marketing and not dependent on peculiarities of national and state grants is a great position for long term growth and sustainability.",
